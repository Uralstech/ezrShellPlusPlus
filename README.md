## **What is ezrShell++?**
ezrShell++ is an extended interpreter shell for all ezr languages ([ezrlang](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrlang), [ezrMlang](https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrMlang))

## **Where can I get ezrShell++?**
Download any releases from here: https://github.com/Uralstech/ezrShellPlusPlus/releases/

## **How do I use ezrM (ezr Malayalam) with ezrShell++?**
With ezrShell++ opened, click on ```ezr EC``` (next to ```Clear```) on the toolbar. A popup should appear.
If you have ezrMShell in the user PATH variable, just enter ```ezrShell```.
If you don't, then enter ```"path/where/ezrMShell/was/installed/ezrMShell.exe"```.
That's it!

## **Shortcuts**
* **F5** - Runs written code
* **Ctrl+R** - Clears console window

ezrShell++ is still a work in progress - Feel free to report any bugs on GitHub
